# TinyEngine

A lightweight 2D game engine in Java using LWJGL for rendering, input handling, and audio playback. This engine supports entities, terrain, player movement, camera follow, and basic sounds.

---

## Features

- 2D tile-based terrain
- Player and enemy entities with health and stamina
- Camera that follows the player
- Keyboard input handling
- Audio playback (walking, hit, power-up sounds)
- Grid-based rendering
- Selector system for directional interaction
- Modular architecture: `Engine`, `Renderer`, `Textures`, `Camera`, `Terrain`, `Controller`, `Entity`, `Player`, `Enemy`, `Sound`

## Controls

| Key          | Action              |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| `W`          | Move Up             |
| `A`          | Move Left           |
| `S`          | Move Down           |
| `D`          | Move Right          |
| `Left Shift` | Sprint              |

## Notes

* Player is spawned in the middle of the map using pixel-based coordinates.
* All entities and terrain tiles are drawn via `Textures`, so offsets from the camera are handled there.
* Tile map size is defined in pixels (`Constants.MAP_WIDTH` and `Constants.MAP_HEIGHT`).
* Sounds are handled via `javax.sound.sampled.Clip`.
* Health and stamina systems include cooldowns and limits.

## Future Improvements

* Zoomable camera
* Tile-based collision for entities
* Enemy AI improvementss
* Animated textures
* Configurable key bindings
